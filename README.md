## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
• ***vehicle_length*** Pr(>|t|)=2.6 x 10<sup>-12</sup> and ***ground_clearance*** Pr(>|t|)=5.21 x 10<sup>-8</sup> are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model

• the ***p-value*** of our linear regression analysis is ***5.37 x 10<sup>-11</sup>***, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is ***not zero***
