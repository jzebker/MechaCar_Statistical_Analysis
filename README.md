# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
• ***vehicle_length Pr(>|t|)=2.6 x 10<sup>-12</sup>*** and ***ground_clearance Pr(>|t|)=5.21 x 10<sup>-8</sup>*** are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model

• the ***p-value*** of our linear regression analysis is ***5.37 x 10<sup>-11</sup>***, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is ***not zero***

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
• the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch
